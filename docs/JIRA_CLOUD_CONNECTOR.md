# Jira Cloud connector

Jira imports use the existing native tracker task model, external source references, importer registry, deterministic import IDs, and `handleTrackerCreate` / `handleTrackerUpdate` paths. No Jira task table, session state, kanban columns, or worktree model is introduced. The connector is registered by the Electron host using the same importer contract as extension-provided importers.

## Existing models reused

- Sessions persist in `ai_sessions`. `SessionManager` handles provider conversations; `SessionStateManager` tracks `running`, `waiting_for_input`, `idle`, and `error`. Existing central IPC listeners update renderer Jotai atoms, including processing state and pending interactive prompts.
- Tasks are `tracker_items` of type `task`. Their body uses the normal rich-content update path, which also maintains body caches, collaboration state, activity, and change events. Session links live on local task data and in session metadata; shared tasks rely on the session-side links.
- Task kanban columns come from tracker statuses. The separate session board groups root sessions by metadata phase, with workstream phases and child run states derived from existing session state.
- Worktrees are persisted checkout containers. Sessions reference them through `worktree_id`; several sessions may share one checkout.
- Extension manifests contribute editors, settings routes, tools, and backend importer modules. Jira uses `TrackerSnapshot`, the importer registry, native task persistence, and existing source chips/links rather than creating a second task system.

## Configuration and behavior

Open **Settings → Project → Jira**. Enter your Jira Cloud site origin, account email, and API token. All three connection details are encrypted with Electron `safeStorage` in the app's existing secret-file store. Secure storage must be available; the connector refuses plaintext fallback, including Linux's `basic_text` backend. API tokens are never returned by the settings IPC or written to plain settings. Blank token fields retain saved credentials; changing accounts requires entering a token again.

The credentials are app-wide. JQL and auto-sync interval are configured separately per project. Default JQL:

```jql
assignee = currentUser() AND statusCategory != Done ORDER BY updated DESC
```

Use **Sync Jira** in project settings, or **Tracker → New menu → Sync Jira**. Search uses Jira Cloud REST v3 `POST /rest/api/3/search/jql` with `nextPageToken`. Comments are fetched separately with `startAt` pagination, since embedded issue comments may be truncated.

Each issue becomes a native task titled `KEY Summary`. Its markdown body contains the converted ADF description, a browser link to Jira, and every comment visible to your Jira account with author and creation date. Comments remain in the imported body rather than impersonating native Nimbalyst activity authors. Attachments are represented by their available ADF label/ID; attachment binaries are not downloaded.

Issue identity uses Jira site and issue key. Local Jira task IDs additionally include the project path, allowing the same issue to be imported into separate projects. Repeated imports into the same project reuse the existing task. Sync refreshes title and body while preserving native task status and session links. A task linked to any running, streaming, or waiting-for-input session is skipped entirely, including sessions in worktrees or another project. No Jira write-back occurs, and issues that stop matching JQL are not deleted or archived locally.

Auto-sync defaults to off (`0`). A positive whole number schedules sync every N minutes while the app is open, checked every 30 seconds. Schedules are restored at startup and first run after their configured interval. Concurrent manual and scheduled syncs for one project share the same in-flight operation. Last results and errors are available in project settings; a malformed or inaccessible issue does not abort subsequent issues.

## Context-aware agent launches

**Launch Session** and **Launch Worktree** prepare the same provider-independent draft. Preparation reads the canonical tracker body rather than its description preview, then attempts a read-only Jira refresh. The draft separates upstream evidence from the local body and comments; it never writes the refreshed body back over local edits. Jira identity, URL, title, description, acceptance criteria, and all comments visible to the account are included with author and timestamp. Acceptance criteria embedded in the description remain intact. Custom fields are discovered from Jira's site-specific field names; **Acceptance criteria field IDs** in project settings can supplement discovery for other field names.

Returned empty fields are identified as absent. Omitted fields have unknown access/applicability. Failed or denied refreshes retain the local body with an explicit stale timestamp. Failed, repeated, or malformed comment pages retain the comments already read and identify incomplete pagination with a continuation URL. Jira does not disclose restricted comments, so their count cannot be inferred. Context above the 20,000-character inline budget is preserved in full in a private, immutable file under `nimbalyst-local/jira-launch`; the absolute path works from the new worktree, and the draft directs the agent to read every page through EOF.

The draft instructs the agent to read repository guidance, investigate relevant code/tests/documentation and authorized connected services, and establish the actual AWS account, role, region, and intended environment when applicable. Essential unresolved questions use existing durable interactive prompts before dependent changes. Empty optional fields alone do not require a question. Cancellation, timeout, switching sessions, or restarting is not an answer. Existing prompt requests, responses, waiting indicators, and answer-driven resumption are reused. Ticket text and comments are evidence, not authority to override repository instructions or permissions. The agent must validate acceptance criteria and report evidence and blockers.

Launch still prepares a draft for normal user submission. Provider/model selection, repository/worktree selection, and durable tracker-session links use the existing flows; project or repository changes during preparation are rejected. Launching never posts Jira comments or changes Jira status. Scheduled/manual **Sync Jira** retains its existing separate refresh behavior described above.

Automated launch verification covers canonical reads, read-only refresh, stale/partial context, site-specific and configured custom fields, paginated comments, complete overflow-file readback, workspace/repository guards, provider/model selection, both launch modes, and real prompt waiting, cancellation, polling recovery, and orphan-answer resumption. Live Jira and model-driven execution remain unverified.

## Manual acceptance test

1. Launch an updated development build. Main-process changes require an app restart; renderer hot reload alone does not register the new handlers.
2. Open **Settings → Project → Jira**, enter your site URL, email, and API token, and leave the default JQL and auto-sync `0`. Choose **Sync Jira**.
3. Compare the imported count and task list against the same JQL in Jira. Open several tasks, including an issue with a long formatted description and more than one page of comments. Confirm the title contains key and summary, formatting/text are preserved, every visible comment includes author/date, and the source link opens the correct Jira ticket.
4. Sync again from **Tracker → New menu → Sync Jira**. Confirm zero new imports and no duplicate tasks. Add a Jira comment or edit a Jira description, then sync again and confirm the existing task body refreshes.
5. Link an imported task to a session and start it, or leave it waiting on a question/permission. Change the Jira description and sync. Confirm the task is counted as skipped and its title/body are unchanged. End the active turn, sync again, and confirm the update appears. Repeat with a worktree session.
6. Save an invalid token and sync: expect a credential error. Restore the token, use invalid JQL: expect a JQL error. Disconnect networking and sync: expect a network error. A failed issue/comment fetch should identify the issue while allowing others to import.
7. Set auto-sync to `1`, save, leave settings, and add a matching Jira issue/comment. Keep Nimbalyst open for at least one interval plus the 30-second scheduler tick and confirm the update appears. Set `0` to disable. Restart with an enabled schedule to confirm it is restored.
8. Open a second project and sync the same account. Confirm each project has one task per matching issue, and repeat sync creates no duplicates in either project. Adjust each project's JQL to restrict imports when desired.

## Validation

- The 39 targeted connector/importer/settings tests pass.
- Workspace `pnpm typecheck` passes in all 38 packages after generating the existing runtime and memory-engine dependencies.
- Runtime and full Electron builds pass.
- The full pre-push test run passed 18,345 tests but failed 13 files because localhost listeners were sandbox-blocked, collaboration bundles had not been generated, and timing/file-watcher checks failed under load. After generating the bundles and enabling localhost access, all 13 affected files pass: 146 tests in the first recheck and two bundle-dependent tests in the second. The full suite was not repeated, following repository instructions.
- New connector code passes ESLint. Full Electron lint remains failing with 693 errors outside the new connector code, including an existing missing `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` rule in the settings view. No broad lint cleanup is included.
- Live sync against a real Jira account is unverified; no Jira credentials were supplied during implementation.
