# Tracker Workflows

This doc covers tracker-item workflows for tasks, decisions, and bugs.

## Tasks and subtasks

A subtask is an ordinary Task with a single `parentTask` relationship to another Task. The parent has the inverse `subtasks` list. Both fields use the existing synced relationship storage; setting or clearing either side maintains the other. Changing a subtask's parent removes it from the former parent's list. Each task keeps its own workflow status, assignee, and optional session links; finishing a child does not finish the parent.

Agents should create subtasks automatically when a task has distinct pieces worth tracking independently, after reading the parent and reusing existing subtasks. Small implementation steps can stay in the original task. Create a child with `tracker_create({ type: "task", title: "Implement search indexing", fields: { parentTask: { itemId: "<parent stable item id>", title: "Search", trackerType: "task" } } })`. A customized workspace schema may use different fields; inspect `tracker_list_types` first. Link an authorized delegated session to its subtask with `tracker_link_session`; a subtask does not require a sub-agent.

If creation returns a `relationshipWrite` warning, the item and its own relationship fields are already saved. Keep its returned ID, inspect the related items, and repair their inverse fields rather than creating a duplicate subtask.

In the Tasks or All tracker kanban, open the field filter, select **Parent Task**, and choose the parent. This shows its direct subtasks and uses the same persisted filter as the list and saved views. The advanced filter's **is empty** operator shows top-level tasks. The parent and subtasks relationship fields in task details let people inspect, attach, detach, or move existing tasks.

## Git delivery and task completion

Local commits link to Task items but leave their workflow status open, including commits with closing keywords. A confirmed PR merge completes a task linked explicitly to that PR, or linked through a session whose clean worktree HEAD matches the merged PR head. Tasks referencing several PRs wait until every reference is confirmed merged. Background PR polling also handles merges performed outside Nimbalyst. Cancelled and already completed tasks keep their status.

The Sessions board derives Done from merged PR evidence; archiving, setting the session phase to complete, or dragging an unmerged card into Done does not complete it. Its Git status column shows Ready for commit, Ready for push, and Ready for PR from live Git state. Push readiness uses the branch's tracked upstream rather than its base branch.

## Recording Decisions

Record a decision where the next reader will look for it. Not every choice needs a record; most need one sentence in the right place.

**In a project with a Wiki,** follow the project's "How we write this wiki" page. In short: mark the decision by default, as one sentence in the page it affects, with who decided, when, and what was not chosen. Also add a **decision** tracker item when any of these holds:

1. No single page owns it: it changes behavior across several areas, both repos, or every client.
2. Work or code hangs off it: commits close it with `Fixes NIM-…`, or tasks and other decisions depend on it.
3. It is not settled: it is still being evaluated, or it holds only while something stays true and someone has to watch that.
4. The reasons don't fit in a mark: more than one alternative worth keeping, or reasoning a later agent must read in full before undoing it.

A record never replaces the mark. Keep the mark and put the record's key right after it.

**Without a Wiki,** write the decision in the plan doc it belongs to. Use a decision tracker item when there is no plan doc or one of the four conditions above holds.

**How to create a record:**

```
tracker_create({
  type: "decision",
  title: "{what you decided}",
  priority: "medium",  // or "high" for architectural decisions
  labels: ["{area}"],  // e.g., "extensions", "ai", "sync", "ui"
  description: `## Context\n{why this came up}\n\n## Alternatives considered\n{what else was on the table}\n\n## Reasoning\n{why this option won}\n\n## Trade-offs accepted\n{what you gave up}`
})
```

**Before making a similar decision**, read the page about the thing it governs and search existing decisions with `tracker_list({ type: "decision", search: "{topic}" })`. Follow prior decisions unless new information invalidates the reasoning. In that case, rewrite the marked sentence and say what it replaced and when; update or supersede the record if there is one.

## Bug Tracking

When fixing a bug, **always ensure a tracker bug item exists** before starting the fix. If the user hasn't already pointed you at an existing tracker item, create one immediately using `tracker_create`.

**Workflow:**
1. **Check for existing bug**: `tracker_list({ type: "bug", search: "{topic}" })` — if one exists, link to it with `tracker_link_session`
2. **Create if missing**: If no tracker item exists, create one before writing any fix code
3. **Keep it updated**: Update the tracker item's status as you progress (`to-do` → `in-progress` → `in-review`)
4. **Link the session**: Always call `tracker_link_session` so the bug and session are cross-referenced
5. **Close it on the commit**: When the user commits the fix, put a closing reference on its own line in the commit message — `Fixes NIM-123`, using the item's issue key. That commit is the user's sign-off, and `CommitTrackerLinker` moves the bug item to `done`. The Sessions board still waits for the PR to merge before showing Done. A bare `NIM-123` only links the commit; it does not close.

Do not stop at step 3. An item left in `in-review` after its fix shipped is a false backlog entry — the user has to clear it by hand. If the item has no issue key, say so when you propose the commit rather than silently omitting the reference.

`Fixes NIM-123` belongs in the **commit message only**. Issue keys are scoped to a tracker room or local workspace: peers in the same room share an identity, but the same key can name a different item in an unrelated workspace. A `NIM-###` in a code comment or runtime log string therefore means nothing reliable to anyone reading this public repo. Cite the GitHub issue (`#123`) there instead. See the tracker-key rule in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

**How to create:**

```
tracker_create({
  type: "bug",
  title: "{concise description of the bug}",
  priority: "medium",  // or "high"/"critical" based on severity
  labels: ["{area}"],  // e.g., "ios", "electron", "sync", "ui"
  description: `## Symptoms\n{what the user sees}\n\n## Expected behavior\n{what should happen}\n\n## Root cause\n{fill in once diagnosed}\n\n## Fix\n{fill in once implemented}`
})
```

**As the fix progresses**, update the description with root cause and fix details using `tracker_update`. This creates a durable record of what was wrong and how it was fixed.
